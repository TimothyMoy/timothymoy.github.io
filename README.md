### Overview
As a designer turned developer/engineer, I decided to redo my portfolio by utilizing the skills I've learned from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive and other resources.

For this project I'll be using the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" alt="Link to Skeleton CSS Library">Skeleton Framework</a> to create the base of my portfolio.

I want to highlight the projects I've worked on at General Assembly, while including my past experience + projects I'm currently working on.
